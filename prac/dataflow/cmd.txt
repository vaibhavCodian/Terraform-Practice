Above is the Code to setup terraform code to create multiple service_account considering all possible values
I want to create a similar Terraform Code to setup dataflow using Terraform in GCP
refering to https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/dataflow_job

Please provide complete code for main.tf, variables.tf and variables.tfvars
